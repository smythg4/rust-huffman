# Huffman Encoding Hand-Rolled

## Issues to Fix:
- Error rate manifests after certain text length / tree depth. Leading zeroes are key culprit.
- Creating the code_table works fine, challenges now come with parsing out (verification)
- How do I 'assemble' the compressed file from the code table?
- How do I uniquely parse the compressed file and return original text?
